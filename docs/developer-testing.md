# Developer Testing

I use the phrase I use the phrase "developer testing" to slightly differentiate what we do in terms of testing as developers from what "typical" software testers do.

The biggest difference is that we write tests as we write the code, often for things that don't even exist yet. A software tester is usually more concerned with the "external quality" of the code - does it do the right thing.
