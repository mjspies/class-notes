::tip
this is a simplified categorization of the multitude of ways you might be working as a developer
:::

The differentiator between these for me is *how focused is your work on requirments that the average business person would correlate with the requirments of the business*, vs. *technical requirements*

## Systems Programmer

creating operating systems, databases, "stateful services", all that jazz.

## Framework or Library programmer

- framework - code that uses your code.
- library - code that your code uses.

## Application Developer

our work and job is to:

- Make the company more money
- Reduce liability

"Application" means to "apply" technology to solve a business requirement

- we write the code for understandability over worrying about performance, etc.
