# Object Oriented Programming

## the idea is to marry state and behavior

```vb
dim myName as String
set myName = "Jeff";
```

```csharp
var myName = "jeff";
myName = myName.ToUpper();
```

# Objects have:

### state
variables that the object 'owns'
in .Net state is in class level 

### Behavior
code that can be invoked that has something to do with the data (state)
